## BetterDisplay Localization Repository

[BetterDisplay](https://betterdisplay.pro) (as of app version v2.0.9) supports localization. The latest XCode localization strings (dictionary files) are available in this repository.

For the German localization, there is a [glossary](Localization%20Glossary%20German.markdown) available.
